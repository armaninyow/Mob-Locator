# Mob Locator

![Mod Icon](src/main/resources/assets/moblocator/icon.png)

## Functionality

* **Real-time Radar:** Displays icons for nearby mobs relative to your current facing direction.
* **Vertical Tracking:** Integrated indicators (arrows) show if a mob is significantly above or below your current Y-level.
* **Hostility Detection:** Uses color coding to distinguish between hostile (Red), passive (White), and neutral entities.
* **Fully Configurable:** Customize colors and toggle visibility for invisible entities via the in-game config menu.
* **Pixel-Perfect Icons:** Custom-rendered geometric icons that blend seamlessly with the vanilla Minecraft UI.

## Benefits
Whether you are caving, hunting specific mobs, or trying to avoid a surprise Creeper, **Mob Locator** provides essential spatial awareness without cluttering your screen with a full mini-map.

* **Lightweight:** Minimal impact on FPS.
* **Vanilla Friendly:** No complex overlays; it looks like it belongs in the base game.
* **Accessibility:** Helps players with hearing difficulties identify which direction mob sounds are coming from.
